Description: # PAI-Utils
        
        Programming Artificial Intelligence Utilities is a package that aims to make
        artificial intelligence and machine learning programming easier through
        abstractions of extensive APIs, research paper implementations, and data
        manipulation.
        
        Modules in this package are used extensively in [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_oJMTfTBYY&list=PLZkmLNZl0Wkw9KSJMBhbalbsxmrjdlgv3).
        The reinforcement modules are used [here](https://github.com/Tiger767/OpenAIGymResults).
